# Implement a Design from Scratch

## Description

In this project, I implemented a web page entirely from scratch without using any libraries. I used all the HTML, CSS, Accessibility, and Responsive Design knowledge I’ve learned so far to create a fully functional web page. 

The goal was simple: to create a webpage that looks exactly like the provided design file. I had the freedom to implement it my way, focusing on precision and functionality.

## Project Design

Below is the design I worked to replicate:

## Key Features

- **HTML and CSS Only**: Built entirely with vanilla HTML and CSS—no libraries or frameworks involved.
- **Accessibility**: Ensured the page adheres to accessibility best practices.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Pixel-Perfect Implementation**: Every detail was crafted to match the design exactly.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I refined my skills in:
- Writing clean, semantic HTML.
- Creating responsive layouts using CSS.
- Implementing designs with precision and attention to detail.
- Enhancing web accessibility for inclusive user experiences.
